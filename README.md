# K-Means-algorithm
Build k-means algorithm for unsupervised machine learning problems
K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
Typically, unsupervised algorithms make inferences from datasets using only input vectors without referring to known, or labelled, outcomes.
The ‘means’ in the K-means refers to averaging of the data; that is, finding the centroid.
A cluster refers to a collection of data points aggregated together because of certain similarities.
